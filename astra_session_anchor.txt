# Astra Intelligence — Phase-101.8 Development Anchor

CURRENT FOCUS:
- Fix and finalize tab_dashboard.py layout (Phase-101.8 NeuralGlass)
- Verify correct column alignment, chart interactivity, and data card design
- Once verified: push entire dashboard/ folder to GitHub

NEXT STEPS AFTER RELOAD:
1. Confirm astra_modules/ui/dashboard/tab_dashboard.py compiles cleanly
2. Ensure independent scroll for Stocks & Crypto columns
3. Ensure chart shows red/green candles and indicators toggle
4. After stable test: commit + push with message
   "Phase-101.8 NeuralGlass Layout Stable"
5. Begin upgrade to Phase-101.9 → add live AstraPredict overlay line

  - dashboard_data.py
  - dashboard_sidebar.py
  - dashboard_summary.py
